    branches:
      - master # Also runs on pull requests targeting the master branch

# --- What jobs to run ---
jobs:
  run-dvc-pipeline:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use a standard Linux environment provided by GitHub
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Set up the Python environment
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.8' # Match the version you use locally

      # Step 3: Install all Python dependencies (including DVC with S3 support)
      - name: Install Python dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install 'dvc[s3]'

      # Step 4: Configure AWS Credentials
      # This step securely uses secrets you will set up in GitHub
      # to allow DVC to access your S3 bucket.

          aws-region: eu-north-1 # IMPORTANT: Use the same region as your bucket

      # Step 5: Pull data and models from DVC remote storage (S3)
      # This brings the large files into the runner's workspace.
      - name: Pull DVC data
        run: dvc pull

      # Step 6: Reproduce the DVC pipeline
      - name: Reproduce DVC pipeline

      # Step 7 (Optional but Recommended): Check for any changes
      - name: Check for DVC changes
        run: |
